# Cozy YouTube Sleep Timer 💤

A gentle, visible sleep timer for YouTube.

This is a small floating panel that lets you:
- Set a sleep timer in minutes
- See a real countdown (minutes + seconds)
- Fall asleep without anxiety
- Let YouTube pause itself when the timer ends

Designed for tired humans, low-vision users, and anyone who wants a calmer bedtime YouTube experience.

## Why this exists

YouTube *does* have a built-in sleep timer — but it’s:
- buried in menus
- invisible once set
- easy to forget
- optimized for continued engagement, not rest

This tool intentionally **takes up space** and **shows time passing**, so your nervous system knows:
> “I am safe to fall asleep.”

## Installation (Tampermonkey – v1)

This is currently distributed as a userscript.

### Steps
1. Install **Tampermonkey** (Firefox)
2. Create a new userscript
3. Paste the contents of `sleep-timer.user.js`
4. Save

That’s it.

No accounts.  
No tracking.  
No ads.

## Philosophy

This project intentionally does **not** try to be “for everyone.”

It is designed for:
- people who fall asleep to soundscapes
- people who want visible reassurance
- people whose anxiety is eased by countdowns
- people who want technology to *get out of the way*

If it doesn’t work for you, that’s okay.

## Roadmap (maybe)

- 🔉 Volume fade-out instead of abrupt pause
- 🎨 Theme tweaks / accessibility presets
- 🦊 Native Firefox extension
- 🌙 Optional no-countdown mode (for folks who find timers stressful)

Contributions welcome — especially if you want to build a Chrome version.
